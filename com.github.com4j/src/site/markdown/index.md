This project aims to develop:

- A Java library that allows Java applications to seemlessly interoperate with Microsoft Component Object Model.
- A Java tool that imports a COM type library and generates the Java definitions of that library.

The goal of the project is to provide a better integration of Java and COM.

## Feature Highlights

- Takes advantages of Java5 features to improve usability.
- Binds directly to the vtable interface (not IDispatch) for improved performance and broeader support for more COM interfaces.
- Supports event callback
- Works on 32bit and 64bit JVM
